# Chronicles

Aarg! This project is fot those with brave hearts, those who never flee a fight!

Do you want to join on a incredible adventure? Want to have your name placed
in the hall of fame, or remembered by the history?

This is the right place!

We have several bots designed using actor models and an erlang-like interfaces
whose message trading is responsible for creating random events that compose an 
epic journey using a Middle Ages theme.

Each time you join a new journey, a new, completely different end may arrise.

But hands on! Nobody would care about this unless you could have your epics 
narrated by a bard - those guys from the middle age that were paid to tell
histories about someone greatest deeds.

Are you lucky enought to create an epic journey? Try it yourself.
